        <h2>About this Site</h2>
        <p>
          This site is a prototype of the game "I Feel <em>Blank</em>", which was
          created as part of a Final project for SS142 coursework at Minerve University.
          This website is meant to serve as a digital gameboard and guide for anyone to
          play "I Feel <em>Blank</em>" with a friend. The game runs locally, so players
          are meant to take turns on the same computer, as if sharing a physical gameboard.
        </p>
        <h2>Controls</h2>
        <p>
          During the Setup Phase, <strong>Click</strong> on each Token to
          select them and move each Player to their chosen starting position.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the <strong>Arrow Keys</strong> to Move and
          <strong>Shift/Ctrl</strong> and Rotate clockwise/counterclockwise,
          respectively. If you make a mistake on your Turn,
          <strong>Backspace</strong> will undo your last move.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once ready, press <strong>Enter</strong> to move on to the next
          Phase of the game, and press <strong>R</strong> to restart the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may always <strong>Hover</strong> over a Token to see its
          current position.

        <ul>
          <li>EMOTION MAPS:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Each Player assigns an emotion to each of their Token's 8 possible
              positions on the game board; this constitutes their Emotion Map
            </li>
            <li>
              There are 8 board positions, one for each orientation-and-color
              configuration a Player's Token can take on the game board
            </li>

          <li>OBJECTIVE:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Win by correctly guessing your opponent's complete Emotion Map
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <li>PROMPTS:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              During gameplay, Prompts provide cues and/or context for Players'
              emotional Responses
            </li>
            <li>
              A list of example prompts is included, but you're encouraged to
              come up with your own
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <li>RESPONSES TO PROMPTS:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When a Prompt is presented, one or both Players may have to
              Respond to it by providing a short (1-2 sentences) description of
              their reaction to the Prompt, based on the Emotion assigned to the
              Player's position in their Emotion Map
            </li>
            <li>
              Responses can be Sincere (based on the emotion mapped to the
              Player's current position on their Emotion map) or Deceptive
              (based on any emotion <em>not</em> mapped to the Player's current
              position on their Emotion Map)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li>PLAYING THE GAME:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Every Round consists of a Turn for each Player and one Insight
              Phase
            </li>
            <li>A Player Turn consists of</li>

            <ol>
              <li>
                A Move, where the Player chooses to either Jump to an adjacent
                square or Rotate 90&deg; clockwise/counterclockwise, but not
                both
              </li>
              <li>
                A Scenario, the format of which depends on the state of the
                board after the Player's Move:
              </li>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If neither of the Players faces the other, the Turn ends
                </li>
                <li>
                  If both Players face each other, then a Prompt is chosen at
                  Random and both Players must Respond to it Sincerely
                </li>
                <li>
                  If one Player (e.g. Green) faces the side of the other (Blue),
                  then that Player (Green) chooses a Prompt that the other
                  (Blue) must Respond to Sincerely
                </li>
                <li>
                  If one Player (e.g. Green) faces the back of the other (Blue),
                  then that Player (Green) chooses a Prompt that the other
                  (Blue) must Respond to Deceptively
                </li>
              </ol>
            </ol>
            <li>
              During the Insight Phase, which happens at the end of a Round,
              after each Player completed their Turn, both Players have the
              opportunity to Guess the position of one emotion in their
              opponent's Emotion Map and get a truthful Yes/No answer (one or
              both may choose not to guess).
            </li>

          <li>RESTRICTIONS:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You must Move on your turn, you cannot remain in the same position
            </li>
